4. Key Components of DL Compilers
- 4.1 High-level IR
    - Representation of Graph IR
        - DAG-based IR
            - node: operators
            - edge: tensors
        - Let-binding-based IR
        - Representing Tensor Computation
            - Function-based
                - Glow, nGraph, XLA
            - Lambda expression
                - TVM
            - Einstein notation
                - TC
    - Implementation of Graph IR
        - Data representation
            - Placeholder
                - separate the computation definition from the exact execution
            - Unknown(Dynamic) shape representation
                - necessary to support the dynamic model
            - Data layout
            - Bound inference
        - Operators supported
